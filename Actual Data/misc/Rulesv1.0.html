<B><LI>Winter Rules</B> - Only within their own fairway shall a player be allowed to lift their ball out of a divot, out of a rough patch or off of bare ground. They may also lift the ball to clean it. The player must then drop their ball according to standard USGA ball dropping rules.</LI>
<B><LI>Lost Ball</B> - If a player is unable to find his ball, then he may drop his ball in the line of flight of the ball but no closer to the hole.  The original stroke is counted and a <I>one stroke penalty</I> is applied.</LI>
<B><LI>Out of Bounds</B> - If a ball is lost out of bounds, the player may drop his ball in the line of flight of the ball but no closer to the hole.  The original stroke is counted and a <I>one stroke penalty</I> is applied.  <B>Note:</B>  This rule applies to par threes as well.</LI>
<B><LI>Water Hazard</B> –  (<font color="Yellow">Yellow</font> Stakes) You may play the ball as it lies or, <I>under penalty of one stroke,</I> drop any distance behind the water hazard (keeping the point at which the original ball last crossed the margin of the water hazard directly between the hole and the spot on which the ball is dropped), or replay the shot.</LI>
<B><LI>Lateral Water Hazard</B> –  (<font color="Red">Red</font> Stakes)  You may play the ball as it lies or, you may also, <I>under penalty of one stroke,</I> drop within two club-lengths of (a) the point where the ball last crossed the hazard margin or (b) a point on the opposite hazard margin equidistant from the hole.</LI>
<B><LI>Opponent Doesn’t show</B> - If a player does not have an opponent, then the scoring will go as follows.  The player automatically gets 6 points for winning the match.  The player will then play against his handicap on a per hole basis.  For example, if a player has a handicap of 9, he would get one stroke on each hole.  Par or less would be worth 2 points.  One over par would be worth 1 point.  If a player does not have an opponent, then the maximum score possible on a hole is par plus 4.  This rule applies only for when a player does not have an opponent!</LI>
<B><LI>Late Arrival</B> - If a player shows up late, then his opponent would score the missed holes as described in item 6. The missing player would also lose all of the 6 match points. For example, if a player arrives late and catches up with his team on the third hole, then he will receive 0 points for holes one and two and the 6 match points.  His opponent will then receive however many points won playing against his own handicap for holes one and two, and the 6 match points.</LI>
<B><LI>Subs</B> - All dues paying league players are allowed to sub for any other team within the league.  Unless waved by the scheduled golfer, it's expected the substitution golfer compensates the originally scheduled player.  Teams are allowed to fill their open tee-time with players from outside the league.  The outside player <b>will not</b> be allowed to compete for points.</li>
<B><LI>Playoff Ties</B> - If a playoff round ends in a tie, a one-hole playoff, starting on the first hole of the respective course, will be played by all matches.  That is, Team A's #1 will play Team B's #1, Team A's #2 will play Team B's #2, etc.  If a tie exists after the first hole, all match-ups will continue to the second hole.  Handicaps apply just as they always do.</li>
<B><LI>End-of-year Regular Season Ties</B> - If two teams tie at the end of the regular season, the following tiebreaker rules shall be followed for playoff placement.  <b>1st tiebreaker:</b> head to head.  <b>2nd tiebreaker:</b> Most points scored during head to head.  <b>3rd tiebreaker:</b> Regular season record against other teams.  These rules are loosly based on the <a href="http://www.nfl.com/standings/tiebreakingprocedures">NFL tie breaker rules</a>.</li>
<B><LI>GPS</B> - As of 2006, USGA Decision <a href="http://www.usga.org/playing/rules/changes_rules.html">14-3/0.5</a> <i>"allows a Committee to permit the use of distance-measuring devices by Local Rule."</i>  As of 2008, the West Blue Golf League has adopted the use of GPS by its players.  If asked, it's requested that players who choose to use GPS, offer distance checks to players who are in the general vicinity of the player using GPS.  In addition, the use of GPS can not slow down play in any manor.</li></OL>
