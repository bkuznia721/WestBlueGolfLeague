<LI><font size="2">Severe weather cancellation policy/procedures:
<ul>
<li><font size="2">Severe weather is defined as weather conditions which endanger the golfer's safety.  Neither light rain, high winds, or unseasonable temperatures are considered safety risks and will not result in postponement of play.  Hard rain, thunderstorms, and extreme cold are all considered unsafe and will result in postponement of play.  Emerald Greens holds the rights for deciding on postponement.</font>
<li><font size="2">Emerald Greens makes the decision whether or not to cancel play do to bad weather.  In some cases, decisions to postpone matches will have to be made at the course. <b>Always assume play is on unless you have hear otherwise.</b></font>
<li><font size="2"><b>Rain After Play Starts</b> - If rains starts while matches are being played, half of the field or more must have completed 5 holes or more to determine matches.  Those not completing matches (5 holes) will have to make them up before season's end.  If less than half of the field does not complete 5 holes, all matches will be nullified.  These matches as well as an entire League cancellation will be reschedule at the discretion of the league President/Secretary.  After 5 holes both players must agree to stop in order to close a match.  In case one player wants to continue, the match must go on or be forfeited.  Handicap will apply up to the point the match was stopped - such as any stroke to be given on a hole not played must not be used to compute the player's net score.  Greens fee reimbursement will be determined by the course.</font></li>
</ul>
<li><font size="2">New players to the league have four options for establishing a league handicap</font>
<ul>
<li><font size="2">Take 1/2 of your USGA 18 hole handicap.</font>
<li><font size="2">Use your handicap from the West White Golf League.</font>
<li><font size="2">Turn in a 9 hole score from the league course.</font>
<li><font size="2">Turn in a 9 hole score from any course.  Three strokes will be subtracted from your computed handicap as a penalty for not playing the league course.  In this scenario, the maximum handicap you can begin with is 17.</font></li>
</ul>
